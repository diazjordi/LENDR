# LENDR
Django Web App to manage the lending of personal items to friends

- Want to manage all your precious items by keeping track of who they were lent to and when?
- Want to be able to accurately accuse your friends and family of not returning your things?
- Want to be able to point friends and family to a list of available items to borrow and avoid having them ask you if it is available?

Then use LENDR! Set up your library of items, add borrowers, launch it and give them the link!
